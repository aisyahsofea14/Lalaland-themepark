Semester 1 C++ Project for Lalaland Theme Park Ticketing System (DevC++)
# Lala Land Theme Park Ticketing System

Welcome to the **Lala Land Theme Park Ticketing System**, a simple yet efficient C++ program that simulates the ticket purchasing process at a theme park. This project was developed as part of our **CSC126: Fundamentals of Algorithm and Computer Problem Solving** group assignment.

##  Project Overview

The Lala Land Theme Park Ticketing System is designed to make the process of buying theme park tickets easier, faster, and more accurate. This system helps reduce human error, manage customer details, and generate summaries for staff and management.

### Key Features:
- Display ticket price table based on:
  - Nationality (Malaysian / Non-Malaysian)
  - Age group (above/below 60)
  - Package selected (Themepark, Waterpark, Both)
- Support for optional **add-on facilities**:
  - Towel (RM10)
  - Tube (RM15)
  - Goggle (RM9)
- Automatic calculation of:
  - Add-on costs
  - Government Tax (6%) + Service Tax (4%)
- Generate:
  - Receipt for customer
  - Summary report for the company
- Store multiple records using arrays:
  - Name, package, quantity, and total price
- Control structures used:
  - Sequential
  - Selection
  - Repetition

##  Technologies Used
- Programming Language: **C++**
- IDE: Code::Blocks / Visual Studio / Dev-C++ (any C++ IDE)
- No external libraries required

## Sample Output
- Display of ticket price and add-ons
- Official receipt with total price including tax
- Summary report of all customers

## How to Run

1. Clone or download the repository.
2. Open the `.cpp` file in your C++ IDE.
3. Compile and run the program.
4. Follow the on-screen instructions to simulate ticket purchases.

## Project Objectives
- To develop a C++ program for a theme park ticketing system.
- To calculate total charges including taxes and add-ons.
- To demonstrate understanding of algorithm design with pseudocode and flowcharts.
- To practice using functions and array structures in C++.
